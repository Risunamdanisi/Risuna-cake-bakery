        <p class="p"> 	 In 2019, Risuna Mdanisi had a strong passion for baking and she afterwards decided to share her delicious baked goods
             to people so that they can rate her baking. After seeing people praising her then then decided to open Risuna Cake Bakery. 
              With the support of a small family loan and the little money that she had saved, she started selling her signature cakes
               in local markets in Giyani. She was able to sell her signature cakes in community markets until 2020,
                which was when influencers and locals were captivated by her unique flavour combinations, beautiful presentation,
                 and high quality ingredients. As demand grew, she was able to hire a small team of bakers to help her with the ever 
                 increasing amount of work since she wouldnâ€™t do it alone because people where placing orders left, right and centre.
                  The bakery opened its social media accounts where she was sharing with the world her products on Instagram, Facebook,
                   and Twitter and through the use of social media, she started gaining a lot of attention. 
                   Customers from all over the place started pouring compliments about her cakes and adding to the already stunning online
                    presence.  After two years of extremely fast growth in popularity, the bakery opened its first location in Giyani 
                    and her customer base now spans throughout the entire Limpopo Province.
